# Dataset
Our dataset consists of two meaningful components:

- FX Quotes. These tell us the exchange rate from a currency to another. We use open (beginning of day) for stability
- TS. Tells us movement of interest rate for that currency based on an index

# Objective

Mapping data in finance is often a bottleneck for calibration. We aim to simplify this process by offloading the heavy
thinking to Spark. With this proof of concept, we aim to show a scalable solution to the century old problem of
relating large financial datasets across each other at dates/tenors.
